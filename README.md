## Donate

Any donations are greatly appreciated due to the fact that Google charges a one-time fee of 5 USD for uploading extensions to the chrome web store.

You can donate to me using either UPI or with Paypal.

## Contributing

- As Google made significant changes to the APIs of Chromium with the introduction to Manifest V3, the theming feature is currently broken, pull requests for fixing the same are welcome.
- I'm bad at frontend development and UI/UX, any contributions in that department are highly appreciated.
- This extension relys highly on jQuery (due to VTOPs underlying code) and as such any contributions should be done using the same.
